# Smart Detector

The Smart Detector section harnesses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms
to dissect individual calls.

The Smart Detector screen serves as the central hub for managing automated searches within your call transcript
data. It allows users to build complex search queries that identify the presence or absence of specific elements 
like words, phrases, or topics. Once activated, these pre-defined criteria continuously scan incoming transcripts,
automatically flagging matches as "issues" for further investigation and analysis. The Smart Detector page is 
organised into 4 tabs which allows the users to create and enable various search queries.

## General Search

This tab allows users to view and create general searches applicable to the entire corpus of call transcripts. It also
offers offers a library of pre-built search templates for common use cases.
